    What is Google Ads and Why is it so Important?
</h2>

<p>
    Google Ads, the service formally known as Google Adwords, is a marketing tool
    that I've just begun to learn about and it's pretty nifty, but complicated so far.
    Even though there's a level of terror that fills my guts when I look at a new program like this,
    I'm super excited to flex my ads muscles and get some six-pack ads. *wink wink* (dad joke).
    It should be noted that I have very little experience with Google Ads -
    I've seen the platform like twice, so if I can do it, so can YOU!
